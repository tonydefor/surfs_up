# Surfs_Up

## Overview
In this module, we spent sometime with new tools such as SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask to build on our knowledge of SQL databases structures and querying methods. We also wrote and executed Python code in a Jupyter notebook and created graphs using Python.

The purpose of the project was to explore business development opportunities to establish a Surfing & Ice-Cream shop in Hawaii. The purpose of the concept is to provide a one stop Surfboard rental for locals and tourists whilst also being a rest spot for people to relax and have Ice Cream or a Shake!

## Results

In our main analyses we determined the temperature data for the months of June and December, we then used our pandas Dataframes determine seasonal variations across a key Summer (June) and a key Winter (December) based month. We determined the following outcomes:

- The average temperature in June was 74.944118
- The min temperature in June was 64.000000
- The max temperature in June was 85.000000

The statistics provide some clarity with what to expect for temperatures based on our data for the month of June

We also queried our database to filter the Measurements table to retrieve data for the month of December. We determined the following outcomes:

- The average temperature in December was 71.041529
- The min temperature in December was 56.000000
- The max temperature in December was 83.000000

## Conclusion

Considering our analyses of temperature data, we can conclude that temperatures vary from month to month and from a business perspective, we may need to plan accordingly. Setting up our database and queries can also help with future prediction models.
